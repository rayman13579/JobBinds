# JobBinds
A [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) plugin to change keybinds  
Original idea was to have a plugin to have multiple sets of keybinds for different Jobs and UI layouts.  
But I ran out of time and couldn't continue working on it anymore.

About 2 updates ago I had a poc which could change a keybind from the plugin.  
One problem existed which I couldn't get around at the time, it changed the keybind according to the row from the current active tab of the keybind menu.
